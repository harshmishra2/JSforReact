Hi! I've been using git bash to push my code onto this repository.
So far I've pushed more than a dozen files, but github seems to ignore my pushes.
None have been reflected in my profile's activity section.
For all past days there is a blank colourless window opposite to what I was expecting. If you know the reason behind it help me!
Till then happy pushing!
